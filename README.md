# This repository is the Python implementation for the CSCWD 2024 accepted paper:
>***Jiayi Zhong, Yaling Tang, Jiawei Chen, Xiaokang Zhou, Xiaocong Xiao, Guosheng Kang. Collaboration-Aware Service Composition Optimization for Production Factors Under Industrial Internet. International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design. IEEE Computer Society, 2025.***

> This repository provides three intelligent evolutionary algorithms for service composition problems in the context of industrial internet environments, including: 1. Genetic Algorithm (GA); 2. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); 3. Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO). There are two different fitness functions used for processing.
